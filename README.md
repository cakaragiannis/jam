This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## JAM.

HAM is a sandwich meat. JAM is a simple playlist maker for Spotify. 

JAM is an evolution of a similar project I completed as part of my Codecademy Web Development course. I undertook this project lacking the confidence that I could build a functional React app of any sort without guidance, with hope that doing so would help me to embed my knowledge and overcome anxiety associated with using React. 

The Result is JAM, my first independant, tutorial-free React app!

Note: JAM is fully functional however some users have reported slow loading speeds from their location and/or browser. Others have reported strange scroll behaviour. If you have insight into either of these issues, please let me know.

Thanks for stopping by!
