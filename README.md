This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## JAM.

HAM is a sandwich meat. JAM is a simple playlist maker for Spotify. 

JAM is my first independant, tutorial-free React app; an evolution of a similar project I completed as part of my Codecademy Web Development course. I undertook this project lacking the confidence that I could build a React app of any sort without guidance, with hope that doing so would embed my knowledge and build my confidence with React. 

The Result is JAM.

Note: JAM is fully functional however some users have reported slow loading speeds from their location and/or browser. Others have reported strange scroll behaviour. If you have insight into either of these issues, please let me know.

Thanks for stopping by!
