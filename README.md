This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## JAM.

HAM is a disappointing by-product of butchering up pigs. JAM is a simple playlist maker for Spotify. [An earlier version of this project (Jammming)]( wild-language.surge.sh) was orginally completed as part of a Codecademy learning pathway. However, I finished the project feeling as if it was far too much of a walkthrough and that I hadn't learnt enough to do it myself, without guidance. 

I left it aside and did the React official [Tic Tac Toe tutorial](creepy-slave.surge.sh) before coming back to Jammming and deciding to have a go at building it from scratch without guidance. The result is JAM and while I've no doubt it's full of niggles and bugs, I'm super proud of how it turned out as my first 95% independant React project.
